<h3>Motivation</h3>

<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
My research is motivated by my interest in harnessing statistical methods to better understand the proliferation of cyber-attacks in cyberspace. The challenge of integrating multiple data formats across multiple sources to develop models that understand activities that are related to cyber incidents.

<h3>Current Research</h3>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">

My main project focused mainly on cyber-security monitoring and prevention models using data analytics approaches. We have developed data to aggregate, combine and analyse information from multiple data sources to actively characterize and develop predictive models to predict cyber-attacks. We worked with techniques such as time series analysis, natural language processing of social media data and classification network packet flow. We scraped, cleaned and fused data from multiple sources to build my predictive models.

During my research I worked actively scraping, cleaning, integrating, aggregating and analysing data from multiple data sources across cyberspace. I did all my data acquisition, cleaning and wrangling in python and built all my statistical models with R.

Moving forward, the ML & AI mantra and slowly creeping into the cyber defence analytical domain and I would love to contribute to projects addressing issues in these area.

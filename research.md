<h3>Motivation</h3>

<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
My research is motivated by my interest in harnessing statistical methods to better understand the proliferation of cyber-attacks in cyberspace. The challenge of integrating multiple data formats across multiple sources to develop models that understand activities that are related to cyber incidents.

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
Cyberspace has gradually replaced the physical reality, its role evolving from a simple enabler of daily live processes to a necessity for modern existence. As a result of this convergence of physical and virtual realities, for all processes being critically dependent on networked communications, information representative of our physical, logical and social thoughts are continuously being generated in cyberspace. The current cyber defences at technical and operational levels have consistently proven inefficient to counter the ever-growing sophistication of the adversary and modern cyber-attacks. Given the interconnectedness of modern societies, physical and cyber events, building proactive cyber defence models that leverage this interconnectedness of events and activities across the physical and virtual realities of cyberspace is an important task that helps detect early warning signs of cyber-attacks and predict the future occurrences of cyber-attacks. The interconnection and integration of links between our physical and virtual realities create a new hyperspace as a source of data and information. The concept of entanglements of events in cyberspace here is a defence analytical framework that captures the effects of activities across the dimensions of cyberspace, on the events that emerge on other layers of cyberspace. The aims are, therefore, to provide a description cyberspace from an analytical perspective and create intelligent data-driven models for proactive cyber -defence.

I am Dr. Ruth Eneyi Ikwu, a doctoral researcher at the Department of Computer Sciences at Brunel University, London. My research focuses on fusion and intelligent analysis of data for proactive cyber defense. I am interested in scalable and practical solutions to identifying cyber-threats with targeted scientific testing and evaluation. My research focused of the application of time-series analysis to spotting discriminating indicators of various cyber-events in NetFlow data. Additionally, as a helper to identifying cyber-events on the social dimension of cyberspace, I applied NLP in developing a CyberLexicon for tracking the proliferation of cyber-gists in online social platforms.

Several practical extracts are taken from my research work. Firstly, the methodology for collection, transformation, scaling and fusing of massive data from multiple sources into distributed systems. The analytical framework includes a data fusion and transformation algorithm with automatic feature selection for scalability. Secondly, the results from the feature extraction provide a snapshot of discriminating features of various events that characterise the different stages of the kill-chain. For example, network connection fail ratio as an indicator of the reconnaissance phase of the kill-chain. Thirdly, a wordlist of cyber-related words derived from a scientific ranking of words from over 1 million cyber-related sentences collected from several cyber-chat platforms. This wordlist can be applied to effectively tracking discussions in online social platforms for cyber-incident monitoring. Lastly, the complete analytical journey of the research provided an encompassed framework for analysing the entanglements of events in cyberspace concerning the cyber-attack kill-chain. This reference to the cyber-attack kill-chain provides solutions from an adversaryâ€™s point-of-view.
<br><br>
ML (Shallow Learning) and AI (Deep Learning) algorithms are applicable in many areas for intelligent data analysis. The amount of data now available and with new insights on how they can be leveraged provides ideas for new pursuits. My current work is now focused on the application of ML and AI techniques in cyber defence. Such as going beyond static and dynamic malware analysis, a fusion of log data across cyber systems for integrated analysis, time-based integration of log data from the network layer with data from other parts of the cyber-system (financial markets, news events).
<br><br>
I have three personal works currently in progress. The first is the evaluation of a combination of unsupervised and supervised learning techniques for identifying host-based susceptibility to malware infections. The aim is to provide a light-weight solution for quickly testing hosts on the network for susceptibility to malware infection. The second is studying the periodicity of scripted network attacks using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). As scripts and bots automate some cyber-attacks to a network, the pattern of connections to a cyber-network maybe extracted from the frequency-domain of inter-arrival time of packets. Lastly, as a future goal, I intend to explore the automatic detection of potential cyber-incidents from online hacktivist campaigns using NLPs and Generalized Adversarial Networks (GANs). In summary, my primary interests are in ML, AI, NLP and Time Series Analysis as applied to threat prevention, monitoring and detection.</p>
